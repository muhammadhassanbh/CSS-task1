            <p><i><u>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the last messenger of Islam, sent by Allah to guide
                        humanity.
                        Born in
                        Makkah in 570 CE, he was known for his honesty and kindness even before prophethood. At the age
                        of 40,
                        he
                        received the first revelation from Allah through the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel). He preached the
                        message of
                        monotheism, justice, and compassion. His life serves as a perfect example of character, mercy,
                        and
                        leadership for all Muslims.</u></i></p>

            <img src="shrineimamali.png" width="250px" height="245px">
            <p><i><u>Imam Ali (A.S.) was the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and the first male to
                        accept
                        Islam. Known for his bravery, wisdom, and justice, he played a vital role in early Islamic
                        history. He
                        was the fourth Caliph of Islam and is deeply respected by Muslims for his piety and knowledge.
                        Imam
                        Ali’s sayings, especially in Nahj al-Balagha, continue to inspire people with their depth and
                        moral
                        guidance.</u></i></p>

            <p><i><u>Imam Hussain (A.S.) was the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and the son of Imam Ali (A.S.) and
                        Lady
                        Fatimah (S.A.). He is most remembered for his stand against tyranny in the Battle of Karbala in
                        680 CE.
                        Refusing to pledge allegiance to the unjust ruler Yazid, he sacrificed his life, along with his
                        family
                        and companions, to uphold truth, justice, and the principles of Islam. Imam Hussain’s courage
                        and
                        sacrifice remain a symbol of resistance and righteousness for all of humanity.</u></i></p>

                        al-Sadiq (A.S.). He was known for his deep knowledge, patience, and worship. He spent much of
                        his life
                        under the harsh rule of the Abbasid caliphs and was imprisoned for many years because of his
                        popularity
                        and truthfulness. Despite the suffering, he remained patient and was given the title "Al-Kazim,"
                        meaning
                        "the one who swallows his anger." He is buried in Baghdad, in the area now known as
                        Kadhimayn.</u></i></p>

                        under
                        the surveillance of the Abbasid rulers, he continued to guide his followers with wisdom and
                        spiritual
                        leadership. Imam Naqi (A.S.) strengthened the foundation of Shi'a teachings during a time of
                        political
                        pressure and maintained the spiritual connection between the Imams and their followers. He is

                        constant
                        surveillance in the military city of Samarra. Despite these restrictions, Imam Askari (A.S.)
                        continued
                        to guide his followers with knowledge, patience, and wisdom. He is especially known for
